-terminals' dedicated assignments can be overlooked/overwritten
-when not moving, flying enemies can react to their own occupation of a tile and needlessly fly higher
-some firewalls do not block movement -seems to only happen if scripts crash, keep an eye out but don't worry
-AI turn still chokes when the place it wants to go is unreachable - fixed
-A pause menu would be nice
-only allow selection/inspection during player turn - done

revisit gen6, gen1 for layout errors

check gen3, gen7, final5 for patrol routes
-flip zoom axis
-increase terminal reset time
-check loot assignments in open labyrinth
