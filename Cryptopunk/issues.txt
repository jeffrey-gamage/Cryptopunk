-terminals' dedicated assignments can be overlooked/overwritten
-when not moving, flying enemies can react to their own occupation of a tile and needlessly fly higher
Enemy AI control loop is broken, enemies need to end movement if they can attack
-maybe check if can attack first, only do movement if there are no attacks to make
