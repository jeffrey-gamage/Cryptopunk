GLOBAL FINANCE MANAGEMENT
Global Finance corporation controls the world's monetary system, determining which projects and which people have access to capital, and which don't. Global Finance does not engage in the rivalries and conflicts of the other corps, and there is speculation that the corporation encourages those rivalries in order to further enrich itself. Global Finance's security programs have a unique feature which causes them to ramp up in power every time they engage an attacker. Security assets: Sentry, Grubber, Haunt, Overseer, Gargoyle, Supervisor, Golem, Networker, Profiteer, Tycoon, Dragon
PANOPTICON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Panopticon Information Systems oversees the production of hardware and software for the modern world, from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products. Panopticon's information security relies on creating digital environments that are difficult to traverse, and developing security programs that are unaffected by such obstacles. Panopticon's systems incorporate switch bridges, which can be used to connect or isolate areas of their network. Security Assets: Sentry, Stinger, Haunt, Overseer, Bot, Gargoyle, Drake, Daemon, Golem, Dragon
SHADOW TECHNOLOGIES
Shadow Technologies provides the corporate ecosystem with surveillance and data analysis tools. Shadow Technologies' advanced monitoring systems provide their clients with early warnings of subversive activity, allowing them to intervene before their profits are threatened. They excel at operating without the knowledge of their rivals, and often supplement their income by selling sensitive information. While the other corps may resent Shadow's covert surveillance, they are willing to endure in order to gain knowledge they cannot get anywhere else. Shadow Technologies' digital security is built around security programs that can conceal themselves from attackers and attack from ambush. Security assets: Sentry, Watchdog, Mite, Haunt, Overseer, Gargoyle, Operative, Phantasm, Dragon
ENFORCEMENT SOLUTIONS
Each major corporation has their own private security force, but Enforcement Solutions makes their armed division their primary business. EnSol contracts their large and well-equipped military to the other corps for contract enforcement, resource acquisition, and facility security. Enforcement Solutions tactical assets are rarely deployed against other corporations, as when one corp hires them to target a rival, the rival will often match their price in order to keep EnSol out of the conflice. Enforcement Solutions' digital security relies on enhanced area control turrets and powerful combat programs to destroy attackers. Security assets: Sentry, Warhound, Haunt, Overseer, Gargoyle, Enforcer, Golem, Ironclad, Suppressor, Commander, Dragon
INFINITY RESOURCE ACQUISITION
Infinity controls global mining, forestry and agriculture. It is deeply in debt to Global Finance Management and Enforcement Solutions, but as these corporations depend on its operations it is not allowed to fail. Infinity's data security relies on large numbers of weak security programs combined with proprietary technologies which cannabilize other security programs to upgrade themselves. Security assets: Sentry, Watchdog, Collector, Haunt Overseer, Gargoyle, Extractor, Harvester, Reaper, Devourer, Dragon
